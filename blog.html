					<p>SCEE has some big news. We have recently confirmed that Dave Evans, author of the best selling novel Designing your life: How to Build a Well-Lived, Joyful life, is going to host a talk on May 22nd. This will be SCEE's second major event, next to the LinkedIn workshop we are hosting on May 16th.</p>
					<p>
					We are very excited to have Dave Evans and we want anyone and everyone to come out and listen to his advice. A little about Dave Evans. Dave attended Stanford University and holds a Bachelor's and Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering. He then went on to work at Apple and designed Apple's first mouse. He also introduced laser printing while at Apple. Eventually, Dave left Apple to help start Electronic Arts, or EA for short. EA is a multi billion dollar software company. They are known mostly for their games such as BattleField, FIFA, and Madden.
					</p>
					<p>
					Overall, we are more than excited to have Dave Evans on our team for the May 22nd event. To keep updated with location and amenities, please subscribe to our newsletter. You can subscribe in the form at the bottom of the page.
